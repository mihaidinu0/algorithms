# Algorithm Implementations
Here i'll be dropping implementations for various types of algorithms in multiple programming languages.


# Recommended Resources

If you're interested in learning more about algorithms, I recommend the following books and resources:
1. [__Introduction to Algorithms__](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X) by Cormen: This classic textbook is widely regarded as one of the best resources for learning about algorithms. It covers a wide range of topics, from sorting and searching to dynamic programming and graph algorithms, and provides detailed explanations and pseudocode for each algorithm.
1. [__Grokking Algorithms__](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230) by Aditya Bhargava: This book is a great resource for beginners who are new to algorithms. It uses simple, easy-to-understand examples and illustrations to explain complex concepts, making it a great introduction to the subject.
1. [__The Algorithm Design Manual__](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202) by Steven Skiena: This book is another popular resource for learning about algorithms. It covers a wide range of topics and provides detailed explanations and examples of each algorithm. It also includes practical tips and techniques for designing and implementing algorithms.
1. [__Roadmap.sh__](https://roadmap.sh): This website is a great resource for learning about computer science and programming. It provides a roadmap of topics and skills you should learn, along with resources and tutorials for each topic. It's a great way to stay organized and focused as you learn more about algorithms and computer science.
